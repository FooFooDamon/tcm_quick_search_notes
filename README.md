or download source code of this project, and use `Eclipse` with `ADT` well configured 
to compile the code and get the resulting installation package, and finally, install it.

## 用法 | Usage

1. ***For non-Chinese speakers, learn Chinese first, because it's natural that
Traditional Chinese Medicine will be fully expressed in Chinese.***

2. ***学习中医药知识，否则使用该软件毫无意义。***

> ***Learn knowledge of Traditional Chinese Medicine,
otherwise this app is meaningless to you.***

3. 打开软件，利用主页面的`设置`和`帮助`菜单，以及各子页面的菜单或按钮，即可进行相应的操作，
这些菜单和按钮都具备`自说明`特性，不必过多解释。

> Open the app, you'll get to know all operations with the help of `设置` and `帮助` menu in main page,
and menus or buttons in each sub-page, they're all self-documenting which need no more explanations.

**注** | **NOTES**：

1. 目前尚不支持删除操作。建议将无用的条目清空内容，并将其种类改成`不限`，
以后的新条目便可利用这些条目的资源，不必再新增。

> Deletion is not supported by far. It's recommended that you clear contents of unused items
and change category of them to `不限` so that new items could re-use resources of them and need not adding.

2. 目前也不支持数据导出操作。要将数据迁移到另一部手机，
只需将数据库文件直接拷贝到另一部手机指定位置即可，详见`设置`菜单。

> Data export is not supported as well. To migrate the data to another cellphone,
just copy the database file directly to the specified directory of another cellphone,
see `设置` menu for more details.
